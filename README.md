# Old Ones' Favored


## Overview

In the **Call of Cthulhu** (CoC), a popular tabletop role-playing game (TRPG), player characters may be afflicted by the **Old Ones**, supernatural beings with powers beyond human's understanding, and then become insane or mutated. Being a player for four years, I have always been wondering what would my characters become after they received the favor or retaliation of those "unspeakable beings", and so I decided to do this project: *adding a flavor of "old ones" to pictures*.
